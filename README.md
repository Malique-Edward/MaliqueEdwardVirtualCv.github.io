This is my virtual cv.
It is composed of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
There are lots of images and moving elements on the CV. I tried to have it as vibrant as I can while also showcasing my personality. 
I felt that it is as I intended it.
I kept it as simple as I could, but added some quality of life elements such as the scrolling animations and the interactive navigation bar that is more of a progressbar than an actual tab containing navigation bar.
